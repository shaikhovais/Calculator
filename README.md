<--------------------------- 3D CALCULATOR WITH 2 DIFF THEMES (Light & Dark) -------------------------->

Created by : Shaikh Mohd Ovais Kadri

Project Description : -> In this project I have created a 'Calculator'. Along with functionalities of a normal calculator, I also tried to make it beautiful as much as I can. There are two different themes in this project(Light & Dark). You can change the themes by clicking on the toggle button.

Why this project was chosen ? -> This project includes a lot of JS functionalities. To implement a Light and Dark mode was a complete new challenge for me which I wanted to complete. By the end of this project my 'JS' skills as well as 'CSS Grid' has improved  a lot. I also got to know about variables in CSS and how we can use them.

How did you make this project ? -> I was able to do small calculations, but at a point I got stuck in 'JS' for which I used YouTube. Design was completely mine. For toggle between different themes, initially I looked up on YouTube and then implemented it as per how I wanted.

What feature, technical aspects you had implemented ? -> It includes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. When the size of number is large the display screen can increase as per the number. Buttons are given a 3D Look and when we click on them it acts like a real button. There is a toggle button at the top, on which if you click than the theme gets changed.
